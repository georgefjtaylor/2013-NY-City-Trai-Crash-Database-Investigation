This investigation concerns the 2013 New York City train crash: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_2013_Spuyten_Duyvil_derailment

Using a dataset of tweets related to the incident (included in this repository) I conducted an exploratory investigation.

Some questions include: 

Who were quicker to report the event? Media outlets or individuals?

What type of content did the respective bodies tweet? E.g, Do media outlets tweet content that is more informative or sympathetic?
